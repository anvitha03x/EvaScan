Project Title
AI-Driven Early Screening Tool for PCOS/PCOD

Description
This project aims to develop an AI-based system for the early detection of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) and Polycystic Ovarian Disorder (PCOD). The system combines a structured questionnaire with digital image processing techniques to analyze facial features and hair thinning patterns. It provides a preliminary risk assessment, enabling early awareness and prompting users to seek medical advice.

Features
* Questionnaire-Based Assessment – Collects lifestyle, medical history, and symptom data.
* Image Processing – Analyzes facial features and hair thinning patterns.
* Risk Assessment Model – Predicts the likelihood of PCOS/PCOD based on collected data.
* User-Friendly Interface – Simple and accessible for non-medical users.
* Cost-Effective & Non-Invasive – Provides an alternative to expensive diagnostic procedures.
